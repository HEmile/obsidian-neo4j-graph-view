Adds a much more customizable and interactable [[Neo4j Graph View|graph view]] to [[Obsidian]]. It does so by connecting to a [[Neo4j]] database. Features:
- Selectively [[Node styling|style nodes]] and [[Edge styling|edges]] by tags, folders and link types ^87894b
- Selectively expand and hide parts of the grapha
- View images within the graph
- Execute advanced queries using [[Cypher]]
- [[Link Types]] 
- Optional [[Hierarchical layout]]

This vault acts as a demo for the Graph View. You can [download](https://github.com/HEmile/semantic-obsidian) the documentation as an Obsidian vault, and use the Graph View to visualize it. Styling is provided at [[Semantic Obsidian node styling]] and [[Semantic Obsidian edge styling]]. 

## Install and use
First [[Installation of Neo4j Graph View Plugin|install]] the plugin. Then, read [[Using the Neo4j Graph View|this guide with a lot of videos]] to get started with the graph view.

To get a feel for how the plugin interprets your data, see [[Semantic Markdown Converter Semantics|the explanation on semantics]].

There are more graph visualization options available! See [[Neo4j graph visualizations]] for some options.

## Development
Lots of ideas exist to extend this plugin! There is a [[Roadmap]] available. A [[Juggl API]] is also being planned, which allows for easily extending the Graph View.

Contributions are very much welcomed. The easiest way to get started is to join the [[Discord]] server! See [[Contributing]] for an overview of ways you can help.
