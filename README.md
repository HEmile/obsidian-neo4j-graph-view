## Juggl 
Juggl release candidates [are now available](https://juggl.io/Installing+Juggl+pre-releases)!
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEmile/obsidian-neo4j-graph-view/juggl/juggl/resources/juggl_screenshot.png)

Juggl is a completely interactive, stylable and expandable graph view for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 
It is designed as an advanced 'local' graph view called the 'workspace', where you can juggle all your thoughts with ease.
With Juggl, you can navigate Obsidian through a beautiful graph!

For example, you can select what parts of the graph to expand, to make sure there is never too much information on the screen.
You will have complete control over the style of your graph using the powerful [Cytoscape.js library](https://js.cytoscape.org):
Juggl has a useful styling pane nodes colors, shapes, sizes, and icons.
This helps you get an immediate overview over what the content of each node is.

## Features
Juggl has many features unique to its graph view compared to the Obsidian graph view:
- Use [CSS](https://juggl.io/Features/Styling/CSS+Styling), [YAML](https://juggl.io/Features/Styling/YAML+Styling) and the [Style Pane](https://juggl.io/Features/Styling/Style+Pane) for complete control over the style of your graph.
- A [Workspace mode](https://juggl.io/Features/Workspace+mode/Workspace+mode) that helps you build up your graph with all nodes that are relevant to your current project.

  - Selectively browse and hide nodes, and pin their location so you never lose where they are
  - Write new ideas and see your graph evolve
  - Save your graph so you can continue working on it later

You can interact with the graph with many of the same options as in Obsidian. For further documentation, check out 
[juggl.io](juggl.io), where you can find information on for example [styling](https://juggl.io/Features/Styling/Styling)
or the syntax of the [code fence](https://juggl.io/Features/Juggl+code+fence). 
You can also open the help vault with this button in Juggl:
