Contributions are very much welcomed. The easiest way to get started is to join the [[Discord]] server to get talking! Here are some ways to help:

## Designing plugins
Ideally, the features of [[Juggl]] and plugins using the [[Juggl API]] would be designed with the Obsidian community. Your input is very welcome, especially on features mentioned on the [[Roadmap]]. The best way to help here is by joining the [[Discord]] server.

## Contributing to this vault
This vault is publicly available at https://github.com/HEmile/semantic-obsidian. If you know of a cool way to contribute, for example by writing or improving a guide or sharing something cool you made with a plugin, please submit a pull request!
If you do, please add - author \[\[\]\] links to your profile.

## Help develop Juggl and other plugins
If you know some programming, help is definitely appreciated! See the [[Roadmap]] for possible features to help on, or submit a pull request to the github repo https://github.com/HEmile/obsidian-neo4j-graph-view .
