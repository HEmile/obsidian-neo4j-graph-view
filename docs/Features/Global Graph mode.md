[[Juggl]] supports a global graph like the one in [[Obsidian]] that shows all your notes in a single graph. You can open it from the left ribbon:

You will get a warning sign when you first open the Global Graph view:

Like this warning says, Juggl is not designed for larger vaults, and opening the global graph will very likely freeze Obsidian! This functionality is only provided as a convenience option for smaller vaults (like the one you're looking at). 

If you are looking for a global graph for larger vaults, we advise to stick with the vanilla [[Obsidian]] graph. It is exceptionally well optimized and can look very beautiful with the color group functionality. While there are plans to include a performance mode to scale to slightly larger graphs, it is highly unlikely Juggl will ever manage graphs as large as in the vanilla Obsidian graph.
