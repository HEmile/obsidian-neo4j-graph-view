Images are implemented using a bit of a hack with a local server that hosts the images in your vault. Importantly, **if you use multiple vaults** you will need to assign a unique port to each vault to ensure Juggl knows what vault to look up.
This can be done in the settings under `Advanced -> Image Server Port`.
