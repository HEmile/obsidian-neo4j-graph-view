The nodes pane opens, together with the [[Style Pane]], in the right sidebar of [[Obsidian]]. It shows a list of nodes in the currently active [[Juggl]] graph. 

Clicking on an item in the list currently opens the associated file. You can also right-click on items in the list to open a context menu.

The Nodes Pane can also be used to restore nodes you filtered from the graph under 'Hidden nodes'.

The color of the items is the same as the color of the nodes in the graph.
