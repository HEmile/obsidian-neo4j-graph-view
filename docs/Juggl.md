Welcome to the documentation of Juggl.  If you want to install Juggl, see [[Installing Juggl pre-releases]].

Juggl is the next generation of PKM-focused graph views! 

# Features
Juggl is a new graph view with many more features than the original [[Obsidian]] graph view. 

## Styling
[[Styling|Style]] the graph in many ways:
1.  Using a special [[Style Pane]] that is very easy to use
2.  Using [[CSS Styling|CSS]]
3.  Using [[YAML Styling|YAML]]

## Workspace mode
A very extensive new [[Workspace mode]] designed for keeping the focus on just the right notes. 
**Interactivity**: You can control the highly interactive graph using a special **radial context menu** and the toolbar.
- Select, expand and collapse nodes
- Pin nodes in place
- Hide and filter nodes from view

**Save and load graphs** so you can always continue your work from where you left it.

You can choose from **four layout options**:
1. Force-directed
2. Circle
3. Grid
4. Hierarchical

### Code fence
You can use "[[Juggl code fence|code fence]]s" to embed graphs within your Obsidian note! You can even use the graph you saved in the [[Workspace mode]]. 

### More!
- **Mobile ready!** While still buggy, the graph works on mobile
- Has a **navigation element** that keeps an overview of the total graph
- Supports stylable [[Link Types]]
- Ready to be extended by other plugins through the [[Juggl API]]

# Implementations and licensing
Juggl currently only has an implementation for [[Obsidian]]. However, the meat of the code is not necessarily reliant on Obsidian and could be ported to other PKM software. If you are interested, you can contact [[Emile van Krieken|me]], preferrably on [[Discord]].

Note that Juggl is GPL3 **dual-**licensed. Contact me for details.
